function K = getKmat(r, q)
%K = GETKMAT(r, q) returns a matrix K that maps a vector of rigid body
%   velocities (translations and rotations) into the corresponding
%   pointwise velocities at a set of surface points. The transpose, K',
%   maps a force density on surfaces to the net force and torque on the
%   bodies. To be used in MFS or the rigid multiblob method.
%
%   INPUTS:
%     r - (NP x 3) array of 3D coordinates of points on the surfaces of P particles.
%         These are assumed to be ordered consecutively per particle, with N the 
%         number of points per particle (assumed equal for everone).
%
%     q - (P x 3) array of 3D coordinates for the centers of the P spherical particles.
%
%   NOTE: Most commonly, this function is used for one particle at the time.
%
%   OUTPUT:
%     K - (3N x 6P) matrix such that K * U maps rigid body velocities
%         to surface point velocities:
%           - U is a 6P vector [u1; omega1; u2; omega2; ...], where each
%             ui (3x1) is the translational velocity and omegai (3x1) is the angular
%             velocity of particle i.
%           - K * U yields the stacked velocities (3N x 1) of all surface points.
%
%   INTERNALS:
%     For each particle i:
%       - A 3x3 identity block in J corresponds to translation (u_i).
%       - The skew-symmetric matrix (via cross_mat) maps angular velocity 
%         to pointwise rotational contribution: omega x (r - q_i).
%       - Each 3N x 6 block of K is [I; cross_mat(r - q_i)], 
%
%   REFERENCE:
%     The sign convention for the cross product matrix follows the right-hand rule,
%     as per: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product

% Construct helper function to get cross product matrix (used for omega Ã— x)
