Directory for files of spherical design quadrature points on S^2.

Due to size, these are not shipped in the GitHub repo.

The user will need to set up this directory, as follows (in linux/OSX):

wget https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~rsw/Sphere/Points/SF/SF29-Nov-2012.zip
unzip SF29-Nov-2012.zip
mv SF29-Nov-2012/* .
rm -f *.zip
rmdir SF29-Nov-2012

This downloads about 28 MB then creates 73 MB of files in this directory.

These are created by:
Rob Womersley
School of Mathematics and Statistics
UNSW Sydney.

They have equal weights 4pi/N.
They are exact for the degree t, and given in filename sf{t}.{N}
where N ~ t^2/2, being only asymptotically 2/3 as efficient as Lebedev points,
in terms of exact quadrature of spherical harmonics.
However, they are (much) more uniform in distribution.
